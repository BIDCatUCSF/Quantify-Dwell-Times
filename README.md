# Quantify-Dwell-Times

Description:

	Quantify Dwell Times measure how long tracked surfaces 
	dwell in interactions with target surfaces. Quantify Dwell
	Times identifies and quantifies interactions that a surface
	makes with other surface objects. Surface objects are marked as
	interacting based on whether the vertices of the surfaces 
	come within a specified distance of the vertices in another 
	target Surfaces object. The duration (in frames/time indexes) of 
	all interactions formed by the tracked objects in the 
	Imaris Surfaces object are recorded track-by-track and reported 
	in an Excel spreadsheet.

Installation:

	To make this function available to Imaris, copy this file into 
	the XTensions folder in the Imaris installation folder, e.g., 
	C:\ProgramFiles\Bitplane\Imaris x64 8.1.2\XTensions.
	After copying this file to the XTensions folder and restarting Imaris, 
	you can find this function in the 'Surfaces Function' menu, 
	as well as in the 'Image Processing' menu under the 
	Surfaces Functions group.

Execution:

1)Select the 'Tools' Icon in Imaris.
2)From the list of extentions choose 'Quantify Dwell Times.'
3)Choose surface 1 then choose surface 2


Output:

	An xls spreadsheet that details the persistent interactions of the 
	surface objects of interest.
